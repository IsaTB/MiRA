# History of MiRA

## Version 2.4.1 (2023-12-13)

* Add option `xtol` to set the relative tolerance in variable change for
  convergence.

## Version 2.4.0 (2022-11-10)

* MiRA use [`VMLMB`](https://github.com/emmt/VMLMB) by default and if it is
  installed for solving the constrained problem.  This package provides a pure
  Yorick implementation of the `VMLMB` algorithm which has a number of
  enhencements compared to the one in
  [`OptimPackLegacy`](https://github.com/emmt/https://github.com/emmt/).

## Version 2.3.1 (2022-02-21)

* MiRA save `CONVERGENCE` keyword in HDU with output parameters.

## Version 2.3.0 (2020-04-27)

* MiRA can compute the *dirty beam*, that is the equivalent Point Spread
  Function (PSF), corresponding to the (u,v) coverage of the selected data.
  Use option `-save_dirty_beam` to compute and save the dirty beam in the output
  file.

* MiRA can compute the *dirty map* of the measured complex visibilities, that
  is the *image* given by an instrument whose PSF is the *dirty beam*.  Use
  option `-save_dirty_map` to compute and save the dirty map in the output
  file.

* MiRA can compute a *residual map*, that is the *image* of the residual
  complex visibilities (measured minus model ones) given by an instrument whose
  PSF is the *dirty beam*.  Use option `-save_residual_map` to compute and save
  the residual map in the output file.

* Data selection option `-use_vis2` has been fixed (thanks to Julia Stadler for
  reporting this).


## Version 2.2.0 (2018-11-29)

* This version can be installed with
  [EasyYorick](https://github.com/emmt/EasyYorick).

* [YOIFITS](https://github.com/emmt/YOIFITS),
  [YLib](https://github.com/emmt/ylib) and [IPY](https://github.com/emmt/IPY)
  are no-longer sub-modules of MiRA and have to be installed by themselves.
  Hopefully, with [EasyYorick](https://github.com/emmt/EasyYorick) this is
  trivial.


## Version 2.1.0 (2018-07-27)

This version introduces a few changes in the available options (see below) and
has been modified to be usable from a [common
GUI](http://www.jmmc.fr/oimaging.htm).  All changes are listed below.

* Option `--normalization` has been renamed as `--flux` and there is a
  `--fluxerr` option to specify the error bar for the flux.  If `--fluxerr=0`
  (the default) is specified, then strict normalization constraint is applied
  (as before).

* Options `--visamp=yes|no` and `--visphi=yes|no` have been merged in option
  `--use_vis=all|none|amp|phi`.  Likewise, options `--t3amp=yes|no` and
  `--t3phi=yes|no` have been merged in option `--use_t3=all|none|amp|phi`.  For
  consistency, option `--vis2=yes|no` has been renamed as
  `--use_vis2=all|none`.

* By default, `--min=0` and `--flux=1`.

* MiRA has been modified to be usable from a [common
  GUI](http://www.jmmc.fr/oimaging.htm).  This is still a work in progress.

* New option `--settings=NAME` to specify the name of a FITS file with all
  input parameters.  This file should comply with the [OI-Imaging
  Specifications](https://github.com/emmt/OI-Imaging-JRA/blob/master/doc/interface/OI-Interface.pdf).
  When this option is specified, other expected arguments are the OI-FITS data
  file(s) and the name of the output FITS file.  If other options are given in
  the command line, they have precedence over the settings in the input file.

## Version 2.0.0 (2018-06-01)
* Plugins can be loaded by MiRA to modify the model of the complex
  visibilities.  See file `mira2_plugin_central_star.i` for a concrete example
  or have a look at [`SPARCO`](https://github.com/kluskaj/mira-sparco) plugin.

## Version 2.0.0b (2018-05-04)
* Can save model complex visibilities (options `--save_visibilities`).
* Add soft-thresholding (skip thresholding if no pixels above soft-threshold
  level).
* Add multi-thread support.
* Use environment variables `MIRA_SRCDIR` and `MIRA_YORICK`.

## Version 2.0.0a (2018-02-12)
* Accounting of bandwidth smearing (with customizable shape and importance
  factor).
* Improved accounting of missing/partial data.
* Multiple possible choices for the objective function used for specific kind
  of (partial) data.
* Speedup building of non-separable linear model (with or without smearing).
* Global setting of the debug and quiet modes.
* Colored messages.

## Version 1.1.2 (2018-05-04)

* Fix accounting of bad data in OI-FITS file.
* Ability to resample images.
* Improve graphics.
* Fix multiple wavelenghts case.

## Version 1.1.1 (2017-01-26)
* Better algorithm to compute the dirty map and the dirty beam.
* Improve command line help, provide a manual page.
* Speed up plots.

## Version 1.1.0 (2017-01-10)
* Provide a command line interface (options in command line have units).
* Provide configuration and installation scripts.
* Now available on GitHub (https://github.com/emmt/MiRA).
* Use Git submodules (see
  https://chrisjean.com/git-submodules-adding-using-removing-and-updating/ for
  a tutorial) for YLib, YOIFITS, IPY to share files with other repositories.

* Wavelength selection is more flexible (you can specify the effective
  wavelength and bandwidth to consider).
* Very fast approximation of the Fourier transform by means of FFT (or FFTW)
  and spectral interpolation.
